To serve the frontend locally, follow these steps:
​

1. Ensure that Node.js is installed on your local machine.
   ​
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window in the root directory of your frontend project.
   ​
3. Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:
   `npm install`
   ​
4. Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the local server:
   `npm start`
   ​
   This command will start a local development server and open your frontend application in a web browser.
